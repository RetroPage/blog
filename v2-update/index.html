    <h1 class="post-title">RetroPage 2.0 Is Here!</h1>
    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Retroity &middot; November 18, 2017</h2>
    <p>Today marks the release of RetroPage 2.0, the largest update ever in the history of RetroPage, bringing massive changes and tons of new features. This new version of RetroPage is more customizable and feature-packed than ever, while keeping load sizes small. Here's the highlights:</p>
    <a href="#newmenu" class="post-section"><h3 id="newmenu">1. More Organized Than Ever</h3></a>
    <img src="/images/settingsbtn.png" alt="settingsbutton">
    <p>We've reorganized all the options into the <strong>Settings Button</strong>, a much cleaner and more organized way of accessing all of the RetroPage options. Instead of in version 1.0 where settings were on the side and took up precious space, your settings are only there when you need them and disappear when you don't.</p>
    <a href="#customize" class="post-section"><h3 id="customize">2. Increased Customizability</h3></a>

    <p>We feel that your homepage should be unique, and want to make it as easy as possible to extensively customize RetroPage. Which is why RetroPage 2.0 drastically increases customizability. Here's what you can change now:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Custom CSS: </strong>Custom CSS allows you to customize the look and feel of RetroPage. You can change text and/or background colors, set an image as your background, make your own theme, etc. The possiblities are endless. With the fact that there are no restrictions on custom CSS, the possibilities are endless.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom JavaScript: </strong>You can now add custom JavaScript to RetroPage, allowing you to add your own functionality to RetroPage. We understand adding your own JavaScript can be dangerous, so we've added a way to <a href="#reset">Reset RetroPage</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Logo: </strong>Don't like the RetroPage logo? Want to add your own spin on it? Go ahead. You can now replace the RetroPage logo with any image you can find on the internet.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Search Engine: </strong> In addition to the <a href="#newengines">new search engines</a> we've added, you can now set your own if you don't like any of them.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#keyboardshortcuts" class="post-section"><h3 id="keyboardshortcuts">3. Keyboard Shortcuts</h3></a>
    <img src="/images/kbdshortcuts.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts" />
    <p>With all these new settings, we've added keyboard shortcuts in order to make life easier. You can open a menu showing all of the keyboard shortcuts by pressing <span class="kbd">CTRL + ALT + s</span>. For Mac users, this is <span class="kbd">Control âŒƒ + &#x2325; + s</span></p>
    <a href="#reset" class="post-section"><h3 id="reset">4. Reset RetroPage</h3></a>
    <img src="/images/retropagereset.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts" />
    <p>Did you mess something up, or do you just want to start over? Either way, you can now reset RetroPage to it's default settings by going to <a href="/reset">RetroPage.co/reset</a>.</p>
    <a href="#speed" class="post-section"><h3 id="speed">5. Faster Than Ever</h3></a>
    <p>In Version 2.0, RetroPage switches from the jQuery library to a more lightweight library called <a href="http://zeptojs.com/">Zepto</a>. It is mostly compatable with jQuery, but is much smaller. In fact, Zepto is 20 KB smaller than jQuery, when gzipped. This means that despite the fact that RetroPage 2.0 adds all these new features, it is actually almost 11 KB smaller than the previous version of RetroPage.</p>
    <a href="#newengines" class="post-section"><h3 id="newengines">6. New Search Engines</h3></a>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, in addition to the previously existing included search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo) StartPage and searx.me are now included search engines in RetroPage.</p>
    <a href="#noscript" class="post-section"><h3 id="noscript">7. JavaScript Free Version of RetroPage</h3></a>
    <p>All of the code that powers RetroPage is completely <a href="https://github.com/retropage/retropage">open source</a>. However, if you want <a href="/noscript">a version without JavaScript</a>, you can use that instead. Additionally, the JavaScript-Free version of RetroPage now has full search functionality, unlike previous versions.</p>
    <a href="#blogintroduction" class="post-section"><h3 id="blogintroduction">7. Introducing The RetroPage Blog</h3></a>
    <p>Version 2.0 introduces <a href="/blog">the RetroPage Blog</a> for news regarding RetroPage updates. We'll be posting to this blog whenever anything new comes to RetroPage.</p>
    <a href="#others" class="post-section"><h3 id="others">8. Other Changes</h3></a>
    <p>RetroPage 2.0 includes many smaller changes, such as the fact that the search bar's with has been hugely increased, or that the blue "search" button has been replaced with a search symbol. These small tweaks and changes should help improve the RetroPage experience. If you want to see all the changes we've made, you can view the full changelog down below:</p>
